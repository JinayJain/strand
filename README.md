# [Strand](https://strand.jinay.dev/)
Write stories with strangers, one sentence at a time.

Every day is a new story. Choose any storyline to continue, and answer the question “what happens next?” Then, see how others continue your story, creating branching storylines from a single prompt.

It's like a choose-your-own-adventure book, written by the internet.

Built with Next.js, Postgres, Drizzle ORM, and a splash of AI.
